# Diabolic script generator

I was inspired by the Diabolic script of [Codex Inversus](https://linktr.ee/Codex_Inversus), so I wrote a generator that renders mostly accurate images of diabolic text.

Note, the letter forms were designed by Luca Vanzella, the https://github.com/alexsincai did the implementation, and I tweaked it to be work locally.
